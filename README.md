## Background
This project signifies a pivotal shift from conventional data analysis methods to advanced programming techniques using Python. It encompasses two challenges - PyBank and PyPoll - designed to apply Python scripting skills in real-world-like scenarios.

In the PyBank challenge, the focus is on automating financial analysis. The task involves scripting in Python to process and analyze a dataset comprising financial records, specifically to compute critical financial metrics and extract meaningful insights from them.

The PyPoll challenge, on the other hand, is centered around election data analysis. It involves developing a Python script to efficiently count votes, analyze electoral results, and provide comprehensive insights into the voting patterns and outcomes.

Both challenges serve as a practical application of Python in data processing and analytics, emphasizing the language's flexibility and power in handling diverse types of data. This project not only enhances Python programming skills but also provides a deeper understanding of how these skills can be applied in real-world data analysis scenarios.
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate proficiency in Python programming through two distinct, real-world challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.

### PyBank Objective:
* **Develop a Python Script**: Create a script that efficiently analyzes financial data.
* **Analyze Financial Records**: Work with `budget_data.csv` to calculate key financial metrics.
* **Deliver Key Insights**: Determine total months covered, net total of "Profit/Losses", average changes in "Profit/Losses", and pinpoint the greatest increases and decreases in profits.
* **Generate Reports**: The script should output the analysis both in the terminal and as a text file, providing a clear, concise financial summary.
### PyPoll Objective:
* **Create a Vote-Counting Process**: Build a Python script to modernize and automate the vote-counting for a small town.
* **Analyze Election Data**: Utilize `election_data.csv` to calculate total votes, individual candidate performance, and election winner.
* **Summarize Election Results**: Present a detailed summary of each candidate's vote count and percentage, and declare the election winner.
* **Output Results**: The script should display the election results on the terminal and export them to a text file for record-keeping and easy dissemination.

The overall goal is to apply Python's powerful data manipulation capabilities to solve practical problems, showcasing how programming can be an invaluable tool in diverse areas such as finance and local governance. Through these challenges, the project aims to solidify foundational Python skills while also demonstrating the ability to handle real-world data sets effectively.
## Data
The data for this project was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
### PyBank Dataset
The PyBank challenge uses the `budget_data.csv` file, containing two columns:
* **Date**: This column records the month and year for each financial entry, reflecting the period of the financial data. 
* **Profit/Losses**: It shows the company's profit or loss for each month. 

Each row in the dataset represents a unique monthly record, combining to give a comprehensive view of the company's financial trajectory over the period covered by the dataset.

### PyPoll Dataset
For the PyPoll challenge, we'll use the `election_data.csv`, structured with three columns:
* **Voter ID**: A unique identifier for each voter, ensuring the integrity and tracking of individual votes.
* **County**: This column indicates the geographical location where the vote was cast.
* **Candidate**: It list the candidate's name for whom the vote was cast.

Each row in this dataset represents an individual vote, contributing to the overall analysis of the election results, including vote counts, candidate popularity, and voting demographics. 
## Implementation
### PyBank
This section details the implementation of the Python script for the PyBank challenge, breaking down each part of the script for clarity. 
#### Importing Modules
```python
# Import modules
import os
import csv
```
First, we import the necessary modules. `os` is used for operating system-dependent functionality like reading file paths, and `csv` for reading and writing CSV files.
#### Initializing Variables and Lists
```python
# Initialize variables
row1 = 0
row2 = 0
change_month = 0
total_months = 0
net = 0

# Initialize lists to store data
date = []
profitLosses = []
```
Here, we initialize variables for tracking financial calculations and lists for storing date and profit/loss changes. This ensures they are ready to store data as we process the CSV file. 
#### Setting the File Path
```python
# Create path to csv file
path = os.path.join('PyBank', 'Resources', 'budget_data.csv')
```
The path to the `budget_data.csv` file is set using `os.path.join`, which ensures the correct file path format across different operating systems.
