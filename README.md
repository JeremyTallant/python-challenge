Python Data Ventures: Navigating Financial Analysis and Election Insights

In this assignment we were given two datasets for two different scenarios where we were instructed to create Python scripts that analyzes the data for certain values and print the analysis in the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyBank

For the first challenge, we were tasked with creating a Python script that analyzes the financial records of our company. We were given a financial dataset called "budget_data.csv". The dataset is composed of two columns: "Data" and "Profit/Losses". Our task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses? over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Here is a screenshot of what the results look like in the terminal when running the code:

PyPoll

For the next challenge, we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. We were given a set of poll data called "election_data.csv". The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Our task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calulates each of the following values: 

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Here is a screenshot of what the results look like in the terminal when running then code:

Intructions on how to run the code properly: 

- First you will need to download the repository onto your computer. 

- Then open the repository in any Integrated Development Environment 

- Click on the main.py in each folder ("PyBank" & "PyPoll") and run the code to get the results in the terminal

- When running the code a text file will also be exported into the "Analysis" folder with the results

Both python scripts are accompanied by an outline to walk you through the process step by step.
